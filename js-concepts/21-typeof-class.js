console.log(typeof function () {}); // ðŸ‘‰ "function" => Obvious â€” functions are first-class citizens in JS and have their own type

console.log(typeof class MyClass {}); // ðŸ‘‰ "function" => Although classes are part of object-oriented design, under the hood they are special types of functions. A class in JS is just syntactic sugar over constructor functions.
// So typeof MyClass returns "function", not "object".

console.log(typeof new MyClass()); // ðŸ‘‰ "object"
// The class definition is a function, but an instance of the class is an object
